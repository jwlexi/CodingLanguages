            <p style="font-size:larger;">Python is a programming language that was invented in 1991. According to 
            <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NorthEastern University</span></a>, Python has become the number one most popular programming language. <br> There is over 19,000 jobs available for Python programmers with an average salary of $120,000. Python could be used for artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science.<br>
            One of the main reasons it's so popular is because it's so simple to use. The following is a sample programming snippet coded in Python: <br> </p>
            <p id = "code">
                Print("Hello World") </p>
            <p style = "font-size:larger;">
            When compiled, it would display "Hello World." </p>
        </div>
